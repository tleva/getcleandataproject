run_analysis.R: The script to produce the tidy data. The script assumes the original 
folder structure of the data stored in the "data folder". Simply run all the commands 
of the script. The script produces two tidy data sets:
- tidy_data_set_1.txt: Only the mean and standard deviation values for each measurement. 
- tidy_data_set_2.txt: A second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject 
 
CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data
